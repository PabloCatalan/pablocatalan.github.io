I am a [Ramón Areces Postdoctoral Fellow](http://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/cambiarIdioma.do?LANG=en) at [Rob Beardmore's lab](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=Rob_Beardmore) at the University of Exeter. We work on antibiotic resistance evolution, combining mathematical modelling and experiments.

My main research interest is applying mathematical methods to biological problems. Apart from my work with Rob, I collaborate with my PhD advisor, [Jose A Cuesta](http://gisc.uc3m.es/~cuesta/), and [Susanna Manrubia](https://auditore.cab.inta-csic.es/manrubia/), working to understand how the mapping between genotypes to phenotypes alters evolution. For [my PhD](papers/pablocatalan_phdtesis.pdf) I studied the genotype-phenotype map at the molecular/regulatory/cellular level. In order to do that, we designed a cool computational model called [toyLIFE](/toyLIFE), which contains analogs of genes, proteins and metabolites, all interacting between each other to simulate a simplified cellular biology.

I also collaborate with [Saúl Ares](http://gisc.uc3m.es/~saul/) on plant systems biology.

You can see [my CV here](/pablocatalan_cveng.pdf).
