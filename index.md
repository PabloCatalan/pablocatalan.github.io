I just finished a PhD in Evolutionary Biology at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, supervised by [Jose A Cuesta](http://gisc.uc3m.es/~cuesta/), with the Interdisciplinary Group on Complex Systems ([GISC](http://gisc.es)). I am still working there as a postdoc. You can see [my CV here](/pablocatalan_cveng.pdf).

For [my PhD](papers/pablocatalan_phdtesis.pdf) I studied the genotype-phenotype map at the molecular/regulatory/cellular level. In order to do that, we designed a cool computational model called [toyLIFE](/toyLIFE), which contains analogs of genes, proteins and metabolites, all interacting between each other to simulate a simplified cellular biology.

Now I'm working on developing toyLIFE further so that it incorporates ecological dynamics, but I'm also interested in antibiotic resistance and systems biology. Well, in fact, anything that related to both Biology and Math will probably interest me, i's just that I don't have the time to work on it!
