The code to run toyLIFE simulations (in C++) can be downloaded here: [toyLIFE code at GitHub](https://github.com/pablocatalan/toylife/). If you have any problem running the code, or would like me to develope new functions, please [contact me](/contact.md)

If you want to know more about toyLIFE, you can read [my PhD thesis](/papers/pablocatalan_phdtesis.pdf) or the original toyLIFE paper, published in [*Scientific Reports*](/papers/arias2014_toylife.pdf), or (even better) our new paper in [*Interface*](/papers/catalan2018_toyLIFE_complexity.pdf).
