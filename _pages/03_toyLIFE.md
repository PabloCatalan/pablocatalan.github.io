toyLIFE is a multi-level genotype-phenotype map that is inspired by cellular biology. toyLIFE organisms possess analogs of genes, proteins and metabolites that interact with each other to form complex regulatory and metabolic networks.

The code to run toyLIFE simulations (in C++) can be downloaded here: [toyLIFE code at GitHub](https://github.com/pablocatalan/toylife/). If you have any problem running the code, or would like me to develop new functions, please [contact me](/contact.md).

If you want to know more about toyLIFE, you can read [my PhD thesis](/papers/pablocatalan_phdtesis.pdf) or the original toyLIFE paper, published in [*Scientific Reports*](/papers/arias2014_toylife.pdf), or (even better) our new paper in [*Interface*](/papers/catalan2018_toyLIFE_complexity.pdf).
