### ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE (with Rob Beardmore)

My current main research topic is the study of the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. 

We use a combination of mathematical models and experiments to try to understand the mechanisms behind the evolution of resistance, in order to develop new approaches that stop its advance.

### EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS (with [Jose A Cuesta](http://gisc.uc3m.es/~cuesta/) and [Susanna Manrubia](https://auditore.cab.inta-csic.es/manrubia/))

We are interested in studying how the mapping from genotypes to phenotypes affects evolutionary dynamics. We developed a multi-level model of a simplified cellular biology, [toyLIFE](/toyLIFE), with which we can probe questions in this area. 

### PLANT SYSTEMS BIOLOGY (with [Saúl Ares](http://gisc.uc3m.es/~saul/))

How much should a plant's stem grow after germination? How does a plant know when it has reached the surface? What are the molecular mechanisms behind these processes? We collaborate with [Salomé Prat and Cristina Nieto](https://prat-lab.webnode.com/) at the Centro Nacional de Biotecnología to tackle these questions through the use of mathematical models.
